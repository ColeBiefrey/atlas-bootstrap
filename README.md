This website is a fan project meant to demonstrate my ability to use bootstrap effectively.
My project is based on the Dead By Daylight wiki, due to our theme of hobbys.
Dead by Daylight certainly fits more into hobby territory for me than just a game I play and is one
of my very few genuine passions.

The following sections of the website contain the specified major tasks:

--

Task 0; Readme: You are Here!
Task 1; Header: Is found on the landing page, Index.
Task 2; Banner Section: Is also found on the landing page,	the Welcome to the Fog.
Task 3; Single Item Carousel: [UNFINISHED]
Task 4; Multiple Item Carousel: This unfinished, buggy mess is found on the bottom of the landing page.
Task 5; Drop Down Menus: This is found on the contact page under the form.
Task 6; Section with an Aside: This one is a bit deeper in, found on the Trappers page, trapper.html
